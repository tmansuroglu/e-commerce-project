### As a beginning we will build the products page, to build it you have to:
#### Build a product component that contains:
  * img of the product
  * Name of the product 
  * Description of the product 
  * A state that indicates the amount of this item in stock 
  * A state that indicates the number of likes the product's got 
  * A button to like the product with an event listener to change the state of the products (liked or not)
  * A button to add the product to cart with an event listener to change the state of the products in stock according to how many items the user ordered 
  
#### Render the product component on the products page:
  * Passing the props to the components from an array of objects where each object represent a product
